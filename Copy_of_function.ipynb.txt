        "  1.what is python and why is it popular\n",
        " - Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its beginner-friendly, English-like syntax, which makes it easy to learn and write.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - \"Python is an interpreted language\", is the most common saying, which is also written in various books, but the hidden fact is Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that possess specific, immutable meanings within the language's syntax. These keywords are fundamental to defining the structure and logic of Python programs and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, or class names).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  4. can keywords be used as variable name\n",
        "   - No, reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have special, predefined meanings within a programming language, and using them as variables would cause syntax errors and prevent the compiler or interpreter from understanding the code correctly. To avoid conflicts, variable names must be distinct from these reserved words.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python refers to weather or not an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
